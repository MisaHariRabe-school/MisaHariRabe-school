# 👋 Hey, I'm Misa!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student from Madagascar, passionate about **web development**, **game dev**, and creating cool projects with **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **C++**.  
⚽ On weekends, I'm a soccer player ⚡ (Left Forward ➝ #10 when needed), and during the week, I'm coding like it's match day.  
🎧 I also sing and make music—because bugs and beats go well together.
